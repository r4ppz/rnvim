# rnvim — My Personal Neovim Configuration

> **WARNING:** This config sucks. Proceed with caution.

This is my messy Neovim setup that I use for everyday coding.

## arrows > hjkl ?!

I don’t get the hype around `hjkl` keys. I’m just faster with arrow keys :(

## Why Neovim?

I just want an editor where I can practice coding without burning RAM or CPU, without touching the mouse, setting my own bindings instead of just memorizing, and having a decent UI. VSCode is also okay, I still use it sometimes, but once you stack extensions it slows down. Full-blown IDEs like JetBrains are even worse: overwhelming, bloated, and loaded with features I’ll never use, navigation is just hard.

## The “rules” I broke (and don’t care about)

- **Arrow keys everywhere** — My hands know where they are.
- **Alt-key abuse** — Modern terminals handle Alt fine, and it's a goldmine for keybindings
- **Disabled some defaults** — I dont fck with macros.

This config works for _me_, and that’s all that matters.
